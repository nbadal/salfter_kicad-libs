OpenSCAD to VRML Conversion
===========================

1) Export OpenSCAD code as CSG.  
2) Import the .csg file into FreeCAD.  
3) Select the "Draft" workbench.
4) Select the object, then select Clone from the Draft menu.
5) Select the clone.  Scale it by 0.3937 on all axes.
6) Adjust the position as needed so that the origin lines up the same as
   before.  (Start with setting the X position to 1 mm.)
7) Select the clone and export to VRML (or STEP, IGES, or whatever).
